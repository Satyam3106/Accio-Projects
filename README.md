# Accio-Projects
This project is about compressing the data OR decompressing the data. 
While compression , it will ask for a file and , a new compressed file will be created at the same parent location as the original file .
While Decompression , it will ask for a file and , a new decompressed file will be created at the same parent location as the original file . While decompression , the emphasis is also on the fact that there should not be any data loss.
Learned and implemented basic concepts of OOPS  like Inheritance , Encapsulation , Polymorphism etc . 

Below we are  working screenshots of this project .

// As we can see in the above image that before compression , size of the file was 24KB. 

 // Below is the image of the word doc before compression

// A new compressed file has appeared at the same location.

// As seen in the below image , the size of the compressed file is 17 KB . 
// Hence by compression about 30% storage space is reduced.

Now let's decompress the file .

As evident by the above images , the file has returned to its original shape and form after decompression.
